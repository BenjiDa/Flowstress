# Flowstress

Developing a flow stress, strain rate and slip rate calculator and simulator for shear zones. 

Functions include calculators for strain rate that incorporate the temperature - pressure dependence of water fugacity at lithostatic pore fluid pressures for as many as nine seperate flow laws. The slip rate calculator takes variables of shear zone width and strain rate. 

This also includes a host of different basic conversion functions as well as a shear zone grain size simulator.
